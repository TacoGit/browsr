# browsr
A simple modern csharp browser.

## This code is not fully optimized
Yeah sorry, got no time

## I did use some tutorials
Not because i dont know how to make a web browser, i was just looking at the dlls to use

## Why so many dlls?
I dont know, i only downloaded 2 NuGet dlls, and received tons of dlls

## There are some bugs
I left the bugs there since i didnt know how to fix them, if you guys can fix them goodluck!
